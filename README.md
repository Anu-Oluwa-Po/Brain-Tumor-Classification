# Brain Tumor Classifier 🧠🔬
A Flask-based web app that predicts the presence and type of Brain Tumor using machine learning. Built with multiple Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on medical imaging data and deployed on Render 🚀.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Classifies Brain Tumors from MRI images (e.g., Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, No Tumor)

✅ User-friendly interface powered by Flask

✅ Deep Learning Model (CNN) trained on real annotated MRI scans

✅ Supports real-time prediction from uploaded medical images

## 🚀 Future Improvements
🔹 Improve model accuracy with advanced architectures (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet)

🔹 Include Grad-CAM visualizations for model explainability

🔹 Support more image formats and bulk uploads
